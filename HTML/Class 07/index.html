    <h1>National Animal of Pakistan</h1>
    <h1>Markhor</h1>
    The markhor (Capra falconeri) is a large wild Capra (goat) species native to South Asia and Central
    Asia, mainly the Karakoram range and the Indian Himalayas. It is listed on the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened
    since 2015

    The markhor is the national animal of Pakistan, where it is also known as the screw-horn or screw-horned goat.[3]
    The word mārkhor is from Persian word "Markhar", meaning "Curly", because of its curly horns comes from both Pashto
    and classical Persian languages, referencing the ancient belief that the markhor would actively kill and consume
    snakes.[4] This regional myth is believed to stem from the "snake-like" form of the male markhor's horns, twisting
    and curling like a snake, possibly leading ancient peoples to associate them with snakes.

    On 2 May 2024, the United Nations General Assembly declared 24 May as the International Day of the Markhor.

            alt="Elon Musk" title="Richest Person in the world" align="right">
    <h1>Elon Musk</h1>born June 28,(1971) is a businessman known for his key roles in Tesla, Inc., SpaceX, and Twitter
    (which he rebranded as X). Since 2025, he has been a senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and de
    facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk is the wealthiest person in the world; as of
    February 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$353 billion.

    Born to a prominent family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated to Canada in 1989 and acquired its citizenship
    though his mother. He moved to the U.S. and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania before moving to
    California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. After its sale in 1999,
    he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002
    for $1.5 billion. That year, Musk also became a U.S. citizen.

    In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX and became its CEO and chief engineer. The company has since led innovations in
    reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. In 2004, Musk joined Tesla, Inc., as an early investor, and became its
    CEO and product architect in 2008; it has become a market leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI
    to advance artificial intelligence research, but left its board in 2018. In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a
    company focused on brain–computer interfaces, and in 2017 launched the Boring Company, which aims to develop tunnel
    transportation. Musk was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2021. In 2022, he acquired Twitter,
    implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. In January 2025, he was appointed head of Trump's
    newly created DOGE.

    Musk's political activities and views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making
    unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, affirming antisemitic and transphobic
    comments, and promoting conspiracy theories. His acquisition of Twitter (now X) was controversial due to a
    subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. He has engaged in political
    activities in several countries, including as a vocal and financial supporter of Trump. Musk was the largest donor
    in the 2024 U.S. presidential election and is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political
    parties.

        photography The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable trade off between storage size and
        image quality JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with noticeable,JPEG has been the most widely used image
        compression standard in the world, and the most widely used digital image format, with several billion JPEG images

        (GIF) is a bitmap image format that was developed by a team at the online services provider CompuServe led by
        American computer scientist Steve Wilhite and released on June 15, 1987.
    
        The format can contain up to 8 bits per pixel, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256
        different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It can also represent multiple images in a file, which
        can be used for animations, and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette
        limitations make GIF less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with color gradients but
        well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.

                align="bottom">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional
        graphics, having support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the
        World Wide Web Consortium since 1999.
    
        SVG images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in XML text files. SVG images can thus be scaled in
        size without loss of quality, and SVG files can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. The XML text files
        can be created and edited with text editors or vector graphics editors, and are rendered by most web browsers. If
        used for images, SVG can host scripts or CSS, potentially leading to cross-site scripting attacks or other security
        vulnerabilities.
